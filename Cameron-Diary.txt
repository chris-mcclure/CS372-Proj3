I forgot to do my diary throughout the entire project but here are my thoughts on the process:

  * Unity is a really powerful tool, and while the learning curve was there if you put in the time there is little you cannot 
    figure out with some time and due diligence.
  
  * The platform itself was very useful as we had no issues moving between Linux, Macbook and Windows machines. One developer
    had issues but I wouldn't take that as representative of the difficulties of platform development as there were a handful of 
    us doing the majority of the development and all on different platforms with no issues.
    
  * Next time, use an input manager. The way we did input we would have to define 8 things if we wanted to just add one more
    button to the game as they had to all be defined separately. There are assets and input manager addons but we just didn't
    look into them in time.
    
  * Overall a very fun project to create, I spent more time on this than any other CS project up to this point including the 
    game I had made in SFML for CS202. That game was plagued with development issues because SFML is a very finnicky library
    whereas Unity is being actively developed and constantly improved. The documentation is great and while there are annoying 
    things (like a lack of a dark theme if you don't have a paid subscription) it is overall a very powerful useful tool. 
    ... If you put the time into learning it. Not even much time is necessary.
